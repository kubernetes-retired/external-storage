# [v2.0.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/releases/tag/local-volume-provisioner-v2.0.0)
This version is incompatible and has breaking changes with v1!
* Remove default config, a configmap is now required.
* Configmap data is changed from json to yaml syntax.
* All local volumes must be mount points.  For directory-based volumes, a
  bind-mount must be done in order for the provisioner to discover them. This
  requires the K8s [mount propgataion feature](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#mount-propagation)
  to be enabled.
* Detected capacity is rounded down to the nearest GB.
* New option to specify which node labels to add to the PV.

# [v1.0.1](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/releases/tag/local-volume-provisioner-bootstrap-v1.0.1)
* Change fs capacity detection to use K8s volume util method.
* Add event on PV if cleanup or deletion fails.

# [v1.0.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/releases/tag/local-volume-provisioner-bootstrap-v1.0.0)
* Run a provisioner on each node via DaemonSet.
* Discovers file-based volumes under configurable discovery directories and creates a local PV for each.
* When PV created by the provisioner is released, delete file contents and delete PV, to be discovered again.
* Use PV informer to populate volume cache.
